- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Emzz Gonzales
- A mask can hide your expressions...
- A smile can also be faked...
- But what least inside your heart...
- can never be hidden in the sight of our God..
- You may not speak the truth to others...
- But you can not tell lies unto Him
- If you want to follow His Discipleship onto you..
- You must have that three special characters...
- Sincerety
- Concerns
- Trust
-
